# SKTCTF
Welcome to my custom Capture The Flag (CTF)-style website! This project is designed to showcase cybersecurity challenges and puzzles that I’ve built from the ground up. It’s still a work in progress, and I’m excited to share it with you.
##  Running the Site Locally

Because this site uses absolute paths (e.g., `/ctf.html` instead of `/ctf/ctf.html`), you’ll need to serve it via a local web server to view it correctly.

### Using Python 3 (recommended)

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed. You can check by running:

**On Windows:**
```bash
python --version
```
**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

2. Start the local server by running the start script 

    <small>This must be run in the same directory as `ctf.html` (this is where the script is located by default)</small>

3. If your browser doesn’t open automatically, manually navigate to:
http://localhost:8000

## Future Plans: Hosting on Tor
Eventually, I plan to host this website on the Tor network to provide an authentic, privacy-focused CTF experience.
When it’s live, I’ll update this README with the official .onion address so you can connect directly through Tor.

## Feedback & Contributions
I welcome any feedback or ideas! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you want to help improve the project.

## Thanks for checking out my work!
